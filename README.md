Cascading Configurations Library


A common pattern for setting preferences for applications is to have preferences defined at several levels.
For example, there may be one global config, one per user, and one per project.
In this scheme, preferences defined per project override those defined in the user config, which override those defined globally.

This library aims to make these types of situations as easy as possible.
